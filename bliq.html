          <h1>UNDERSTAND</h1>
          <p>
            “In order to solve a problem, you need to understand a problem.” This
            means that the first step will be analyzing the current market
            competitors and what they offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through a competitive analysis, I will be able to find out
            information about the strongest competitors in the current market,
            what marketing strategy they use to attract customers, and customer
            support options since nowadays many people rely on online support
            and also don’t have the time or other circumstances to go ...

          <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
          <p>
            Users need a way to make secure transactions and keep track of their
            spending because the increasing use of online banking and phone
            payments exposes them to a higher risk of scams and fraud.​
          </p>
          <p>
            We will know this to be true when we see a reduction of fraud
            reports, and a rise of new users due to the words of safe banking
            spreading around.

          <h3>COMPETITOR ANALYSIS</h3>
          <p>
            Analyzing two major competitors provides valuable insights into
            current market, user expectations, and industry standards, helping
            to guide the overall design strategy.
